        <p>This simulation was originally made by <a href="http://www.shanekillian.org/apps/herd.html">Shane Killian</a>
            although it appears the original is no longer online.</p>
        <p>My code was modified from code by <a href="https://www.software3d.com/Home/Vax/Immunity.php">Robert Webb</a>
            and rewritten to enhance the distinction between infected and non-infected individuals.</p>
