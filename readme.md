## Herd Immunity Simulator

A simple simulator originally written in JavaScript, but translated to Rust and redeployed using Web Assembly.

Original author [Shane Killian](http://www.shanekillian.org/apps/herd.html) although his original app appears to have been taken offline.

The code I translated was written [Robert Webb](https://www.software3d.com/Home/Vax/Immunity.php)

The intended purpose of this was to be used with my 7th grade science class, while talking about disease spread and the importance of vaccination in protecting vulnerable populations and improving overall public health.
